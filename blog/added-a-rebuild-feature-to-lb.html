<h1>Added a rebuild feature to lb</h1>
<small class='standalone'>[<a href='https://hampton.pw/'>home</a>&mdash;<a href='../2020.html#added-a-rebuild-feature-to-lb'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='added-a-rebuild-feature-to-lb.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
As previously discussed this blog is run using lb by Luke Smith.
It is a really nice bit of software but lacks a few features I wish it had.
The first of the features being a rebuild function.
A rebuild function would rebuild all the HTML files in the blogs folder so that as I change the template the files all change.

For my first project with modifying lb, I decided to tackle that problem and that feature has now been added.
Going through Github commit history for my fork of lb is rather a big mess due to some issues with exponential duplication of the RSS and HTML feed, but all the changes made were on <a href="https://github.com/herohamp/lb/blob/1fbbbea960f583dc49b305bab9df130bf60a23f8/lb#L64-L95">lines 64 to 95 of the lb executable in commit #1fbbbea</a>.
