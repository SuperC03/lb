<p>All of the blog posts I have published</p>

<!-- LB -->
Within a few minutes, I was up in running.
It also makes adding and publishes posts super easy with intuitive and easy commands.
With all of its benefits lb lacks in the expandability category for me because I am not great with complex shell scripts, but with time I am sure I will get there.
It is also quite a pain to rebuild already generated pages after the blog's theme changes, but that sounds like a good first project.
